# 💰 Personal Budget Summary (2021–2022)

## 📊 Project Overview  
This Excel-based **Personal Expense Tracker** provides a complete summary of income, expenses, and category-wise spending for the financial year **2021–2022**.  
It was built to practice **data cleaning**, **data validation**, and **data analysis** in Microsoft Excel, transforming raw expense entries into an interactive and insightful dashboard.


## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
The dataset was rendered from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syahrulapriansyah/expense-data1). Then it was cleaned and prepared for analysis using the following steps:
- Removed duplicate and irrelevant entries  
- Replaced missing or null values with “N/A” for consistency  
- Standardized numeric, currency, and date formats  
- Corrected category names and expense classifications  
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight high-spending categories  


## ✅ Data Validation  
To ensure data accuracy and prevent future entry errors: 
- Applied **input restrictions** to prevent negative or invalid amounts  
- Enabled **error alerts** for incorrect data types  
- Maintained structured data entry for reliability and repeatability  


## 📈 Dashboard Features  
The Excel dashboard includes:
- **Category-wise Income and Expense Table** with total calculations  
- **Profit/Loss Summary**, showing a deficit of **₹3,164**  
- **Pie Chart Visualization** for the *Top 5 “Other” Expenses*  
- **Conditional Formatting** for quick visual analysis  


## 💡 Key Insights  
- **Food (₹23,396.76)** and **Household (₹12,188.00)** were the largest expense categories — together responsible for most of the total loss.  
- Despite total income of **₹54,754.00**, total expenses reached **₹57,918.28**, resulting in a **net loss of ₹3,164**.  
- “Other” expenses (**₹5,117.00**) — including repayments and transfers — can be reorganized or minimized for better financial management.  
- Small, frequent expenses (like mobile recharges and short-term loans) add up significantly over time.  


## 🧠 Recommendations  
- **Set monthly caps** for high-expense categories such as Food and Transportation.  
- **Break down the “Other” category** into detailed subcategories for more accurate tracking.
  

## 🧾 Tools & Skills Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** (Data Cleaning, Validation, and Analysis)  
- **Pivot Tables & Conditional Formatting**  
- **Visualization:** Pie Chart & Summary Dashboard  
- **Formulas:** `IF`, `SUMIFS`, `FILTER`, `CHOOSE`  


## 📚 Outcome  
This project demonstrates how **structured Excel analysis** can convert everyday financial data into actionable insights, improving both **financial awareness** and **data analytics proficiency**.
